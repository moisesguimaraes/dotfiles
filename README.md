# moisesguimaraes' dotfiles

My configuration. Minimalist, but helps me save a few thousand keystrokes a day.

Nowadays I use both Fedora and Mac OS X. I've been using OS X on a daily bassis since 2009, so when I started working at Red Hat I chose Fedora for my Lenovo P50.

My dotfiles are aimed towards reducing the differences in keyboard shortcuts and the apps I run most of the time are:

- vim & visual studio code (code editors)
- zsh + ohmyzsh (shell)
- kitty (terminal)
- firefox (browser)
